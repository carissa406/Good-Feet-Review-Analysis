7,I believe new insoles really helped to address a lower back muscle cramping. It’s been about 2 weeks and I don’t feel that ache as much. The back is more relaxed I think. I usually walk 4-6 miles a day and so for so good!,5,1/29/2022 14:11,0

14,"So far very dissatisfied with the inserts. Going on 4 weeks with no relief from them. Had to go back to the doctor to get anti inflammation drugs so I could walk.
Good feet had texted me about my satisfaction and I gave it a 2 rating, they followed with a phone call saying my salesman would be getting back to me in 24 to 48 hours. That was almost a week ago and no phone call. Right now I would not recommend.",1,9/16/2021 16:10,1
15,Service was great. But I can't seem to find the right maintainer insert. Im on my second pair in 4 weeks .after a couple hours of walking each day my left heel is still in pain. Hopefully the next set will work out.,4,8/28/2021 20:01,0

After hearing the commercials for Good Feet I went in for the free consultation. Within an hour the pain I thought I would have to live with and have lived with for years was gone. I will be hiking in the Grand Canyon because of Good Feet. If you have pain don't wait go and get the free consultation. The price is high but there is financing and to be pain free is priceless!",5,8/5/2021 18:32,0

20,"I was here at good feet about 22 years ago!  I followed there wearing instructions to the letter. I cooked at a restaurant and was always on my feet. They said I would need the 3 step system. One had a ball in them to give you arch support. One was a gel for any heal shoe. And the last hard acrylic type for all other shoes. I was a single mother, my son’s father passed away.. So I was desperate for relief. I couldn’t use them and they wouldn’t give me a refund. They were around $600.00 dollars. I didn’t have insurance. I finally made a appointment pediatric dollar paid cash and had actual cast made of my feet and they were $250 and $100 office call. They were wonderful. These may work for some but not all. Just please look around and make some phone calls, before you decide.",1,5/10/2021 12:53,2

22,"2/20/21 I first talked to online chat. I kept asking how does The Good Feet store do their business.  The only thing the online chat lady said was the cost of the shoes, I'm think that's all I needed. No, the do a bare and switch.  They want to sell you 3 step process,  which cost 1,700.00 people.  Don't get fooled. We want help but not the debt.  It's ridiculous  and  ashamed!  Y'all need to tell people upfront what it cost before y'all make people think it comes with the high  price of the shoes. Then I read a review  where they don't do refunds. Oh, no scams!!!",1,2/21/2021 18:50,2

Follow the advise of getting used to wearing them!!!

They need to devise someway to make them stay in place in your shoe!

27,"Like so many of the reviews here, it was a snake oil sales pitch & I fell for it.  Yeah, felt good in store & walked upright. Yet, the person never looked at my feet which would have told him that my shoes were too tight for bunions & that was causing the pains he stated the good feet materials would alleviate. Spent a whole 10 minutes with us & KNEW the answer...... NOPE!! It took a PT student at a running shoe store to make the connection & now with wider shoes, the pain is gone. So, beware; they are there to do 1 thing & that is to promise relief to desperate people with the one (overpriced) product they have. May work for some, & it sure was an expensive lesson for me.",1,12/2/2020 15:24,1
28,"I have heard their commercials blasting all over the radio, so I tried I had severe foot pain and needed help. Well I went to the Mayfair store and it seems the pitch began, these did feel great on my feet in store, but in a short time had more pain than before. The sales rep made it look like she knew what she was doing and yet it was all part of the show. Note these may help some people, but these people are not medical professionals and do not buy these over priced inserts without a doctors opinion first. Very expensive and totally dissatisfied, couldn't get my money back either.",1,11/24/2020 23:18,1

35,"I have rheumatoid arthritis (RA)  and I work full time as a nurse practitioner. I am on my feet a lot, and i thought that the good feet store would be my solution. I was so desperate that I was willing to pay for good orthotics. After visiting the good feet store, I purchased the 3-step system which to my disbelief cost me $1687, for 3 orthotics! But again, I was desperate so so did it. A few days later, I saw my rheumatologist who did an x-ray of my feet. The foot pain I was experiencing was actually not from my arches, it was from my RA. My doctor changed around my medications and also increased some of the doses, which provided me full relief in only a few days. I called the good feet store exactly 2 weeks after purchasing this system (also, I have not yet wore the orthotics, not even once), and I asked for a refund since my rheumatologist figured out the problem. I was told that there are no refunds but that he would reach out to his authorities and would get back to me later that day, or the following day at the latest. That was 3 days ago and I still have not heard back. Since I spent an obscene amount of money  and since I never wore the orthotics and have found a solution from my rheumatologist, I would like a full refund. I will update my review once I hear back from the good feet store. But I am hoping that there customer service will do the right thing and refund me in full since it’s only been 2 weeks and the orthotics have NEVER been worn. I will update later after hearing back, which hopefully will be soon.",1,9/11/2020 22:39,3

We had agreed on a cost of 369 dollars (still overpriced plastic but I agreed). When i got my I was charged additional fees that I did not catch, which I was given the impression were included in our agreed upon fee. I really feel like it was done on purpose by the gentleman who sold them.
Who pays 1200 for plastic orthotics and felt insoles and velcro buttons.

66,"I purchased the arch supports in June and have have used them daily for 2.5 months. First and most importantly they work and my pain has been significantly reduced or eliminated given the day. I am active playing tennis and bike riding weekly and the pain I was regularly experiencing has disappeared!

I must comment on the less than professional sales experience at the Milwaukee location. It was rushed, the sales person (Patrick) was annoyed at my very basic questions and he avoided all questioning regarding the Life Time Service Plan (LTSP). A plan that I received a half page sheet on the benefits only after I asked for 3 different times. It does not say what is covered - I have been back to the store on two different occasions to have pads replaced that had fallen off the arches only to be told that is normal and the LTSP doesn’t cover that item? What does it cover because nothing is listed on the half page sheet.

Given the price of the arch support system (over $625) I would expect a better in-store and after service sales experience.",3,9/3/2019 13:18,0

69,My wife and I both purchased Good Feet from Nancy. We were very pleased with the results. Today during the heat wave my wife noticed she has lost her left Good Feet at one of the garden show homes. She was distraught at the thought of having to replace it at a high cost. Thank goodness Patrick was nice enough to replace it at no cost. The humidity had made the sticky pad slide off. Would suggest using a better pad.

88,Good Feet came highly recommended by my colleague. I booked an appointment at the Wauwatosa Branch. Patrick was our point of contact. He evaluated my son’s feet and provided us with the right arch for his flat feet. He was knowledgeable professional and answered all of our questions. The only issue is that he went over things very fast. Obviously he is an expert on his area but it would be nice to slow down when advising new patients and explaining the options they had. The other thing is that he recommended buying the warranty but I had to ask a few times to provide me with a warranty brochure which they did not have. Any warranty must have a brochure that states clearly what it covers. He seemed annoyed by my questioning and then gave me a piece of paper with one paragraph stating general terms of the warranty (after I bought it). It did not instill confidence and I did not like the way we were being rushed.Hopefully we paid for the exact things that he claimed.,3,3/18/2019 16:24,1

101,"Visited the store and tried on a couple inserts. They felt okay for the few minutes I was in them. The salesman seemed cool at first but, then the sales pitch of the salesman changed after I told him I needed to think about the purchase and do a little research after he told me the price. It's not like these inserts are a couple dollars, they are upwards of a couple hundred dollars. The cheap advertising they show is not for the average person that comes in the store. I'm pretty sure that's a surprise to many people that are not looking to spend a couple hundred dollars on shoe inserts. When your making a big purchase that doesn't have 100% guarantee or have a no refund policy, thats definitely something to think about first to ensure this purchase will resolve your issue. Continuous adjustments to the inserts after the purchase doesn't correct the original issue, seems to be masking it hoping your feet will get use to the adjustment. After the salesman seen that I was undecided, his demeanor changed and he kind of rushed me along and made me feel bad for not making the purchase. Very pricey and gives a sales pitch of a car salesman. For that reason I will not come back here. I rather walk on my aching feet.",1,5/3/2018 16:37,3

I switch between the Alzners and Maintainers for such heavy ""on my feet"" activities and the problem is solved.  Thanks Mike.  Mike M.",5,11/4/2016 17:17,0

110,"This is my 5 year anniversary of walking into the good feet store.  I was just talking with a friend about foot pain and told him it was the best money I have spent. Yes, it was 4 times the cost that I had in my head walking in to the store but 5 years later I have been pain free and never think about my feet.  That's RIGHT......not the first thing I think about getting out of bed..........the second thing I think about walking down the hall.........or the dreaded walk to the office after sitting in a car for 30 minutes.  Nope, 5 years and they never cross my mind.  At 36 now I felt I was too young to have foot pain 5 years ago, after the GOOD FEET Store I was right.  If you are thinking about checking these inserts out I can't tell you enough that you will be extremely satisfied down the road. I had 75% less pain after 1 week and was pain free after 2 weeks.  Save up a little longer because in this case you get what you pay for!  Top quality and Top service!  Instead of walking on broken glass I again walk with purpose, thanks GOOD FEET STORE!",5,6/17/2016 11:47,2
111,"I've been wearing the Good Feet inserts for at least 5 years, and love them. I recently went to the store to pick up a couple of foot pads that go over my inserts and was introduced to the Brooks Shoes. I've ran in one of the most recent 1/2 marathons in Milwaukee and I was looking to replace my running shoes. I was very glad I did because they are very comfortable and work well with my inserts. Of course good inserts ..good shoes....Good Feet!",5,7/27/2015 18:00,0
112,Recently purchased some new inserts from the Good Feet store in West Allis. I have been wearing them for years but needed a different one for the pain I was having. I have been working with Dan at the West Allis location and he rocks. I have had to come back a few times to adjust the the insert. Dan has been nothing but wonderful. It is people like Dan that give customer service a great name.,5,7/10/2015 16:21,0
113,"Stopped in to see Patrick to get insole cushions 05/06/2015. Bought arch supports that cured my plantar fasciitis in the late 1990's with phenomenal relief the very first week, something not achieved with custom orthotic from Orthopedist! Still wear everyday orthotics for flat feet and say ""Ah..."" every time I walk. Thanks for your quality product and continued support after all these years.",5,5/7/2015 17:14,0
114,The product is good but their sales approach is similar to buying a car.   You don't get to the bottom line until the very end even though I asked several times.   They try to oversell to get you to buy the priciest package and when you tell them you are going to think about the purchase and leave the store they suddenly come up with a less expensive (still pricey) option.   I would prefer they be upfront in the beginning rather than lead you on during the process of trying on the inserts.,3,5/2/2015 11:23,3
115,"Very Expensive, 1 Set of supports/insoles $380. It's not really a scam, but way over priced.
Should've known when the Rep/Salesman avoided telling me the price till the end,and the ALL SALES ARE FINAL was  on the bill.",2,11/18/2014 12:47,0
116,"Great experience today. Salesperson very informative and kind. Signs for financing were the first clue it would be expensive.  As the salesman first started to talk to me I asked about starting costs.  he said we would get to that.  After about 10 minutes, and we were getting to wrap things up, he then told us the total cost which was about $1000.  Husband was shocked as he heard radio ads starting at $79.00.  Quickly the salesperson said they had something for those situations.  Well...now they had other inserts starting around 79.  These don't have a lifetime warranty, but can be traded toward a purchase of the upgraded inserts.  Still left paying over $200.  good news is that my feet already felt better when I walk.",1,5/31/2014 17:38,2
117,Ask price up front.  The (almost $900) surprise at the register was way more than I expected!  No return policy once you have paid.,3,11/19/2013 22:21,0
118,Staff welcomed me and seemed to be very knowledgeable about my heel and hip pain. since wearing the good feet arch supports my hip pain has been considerably less and my feet and heels are feeling better. I had no idea that my hip pain was related to my feet. Thanks,5,10/22/2013 22:30,0
119,"My visit to the Good Feet Store in Milwaukee was very good. Mike was very helpful, explaining how the inserts will help my overall posture and assist in limiting my foot and back pain. In just two weeks, I feel so much better. Thanks for overall great service and great product!",5,10/12/2013 13:33,0
120,"I'm having both knees replaced in November, so I was interested in shoes that would aid in my recovery. I also have problem feet, so wanted to look into solutions for that as well. Found both and am extremely pleased at this point. Pricey...yes, but so far seems to be well worth the expense.",5,10/4/2013 14:27,0
121,"I had a great experience! Purchased 2 sets of supports to help my bad plantar fasciitis. My symptoms were terrible while 7 months pregnant and they worked tremendously to stop the pain. I am continuing to wear them now that baby is born and I swear they have cured my foot pain and leg cramps!

Although I wasn't thrilled about the price tag, I am reassured that they have a lifetime warranty... and the results were worth it. Other supports were not cutting it.",5,10/3/2013 20:52,0
